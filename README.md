#Dart Quiz App 

This is a console application. It displays a welcome message with the current date and time of running the program.

Based on the option selected, it provides 10 predefines questions to the user and prints out the score at the end of the quiz. 

The Quiz is console based so all inputs are on the terminal. Also, the application is purely dart.
